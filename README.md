# Optix

Optix is an unobtrusive, composable command line parser based on Trollop.


## Features

* Lightweight, unobtrusive syntax.
  No subclassing or introduction of dependencies.

* Nested subcommands such as `git remote show origin` may be composed at runtime in arbitrary order.

* Subcommands inherit from their parent. Common options (such as '--debug' or '--loglevel')
  need to be declared only once to make them available to an entire branch.

* Stands on the shoulders of [Trollop](http://trollop.rubyforge.org) (by William Morgan), one of the most complete and robust
  option-parser implementations ever created.

* Automatic validation and help-screens.

* Strong test-suite.

## Installation

    $ gem install optix

## Example

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require 'optix'

module Example
  module Printer
    # Declare the "root"-command 
    Optix::command do
      text "I am printer. I print strings to the screen."
      text "Please invoke one of my not so many sub-commands."
  
      # Declare a global option (all subcommands inherit this)
      opt :debug, "Enable debugging", :default => false
    end
  
    # Declare sub-command 
    Optix::command 'print' do
      desc "Print a string"
      text "Print a string to the screen"
      params "<string>"
  
      opt :count, "Print how many times?", :default => 1
  
      # This block is invoked when validations pass.
      exec do |cmd, opts, argv|
        if argv.length < 1
          raise Optix::HelpNeeded
        end

        puts "DEBUGGING IS ENABLED!" if opts[:debug]
        (1..opts[:count]).each do
          puts argv.join(' ') 
        end
      end
    end
  end
end

if __FILE__ == $0
  # Perform the actual parsing and execution.
  Optix.invoke!(ARGV)
end
```

The above code in action:

```
$ ./printer.rb --help

Usage: ./printer.rb <subcommand>
 
I am printer. I print strings to the screen.
Please invoke one of my not so many sub-commands.
 
Options:
  --debug, -d:   Enable debugging
   --help, -h:   Show this message

Commands:
   print   Print a string
 
```

See the `examples/`-folder for more elaborate examples.

## Documentation

### Commands and Sub-Commands

Commands may be declared anywhere, at any time, in any order.
Declaring the "root"-command looks like this:

```ruby
require 'optix'

Optix::command do
  # opts, triggers, etc
end
```

Now, let's add a sub-command:

```ruby
Optix::command 'sub' do
  # opts, triggers, etc
end
```

And finally, a sub-sub command:

```ruby
Optix::command 'sub sub' do
  # opts, triggers, etc
end
```

Remember: Optix doesn't care about the order of declarations.
The `sub sub` command may be declared prior to the `sub` command.
 
A common pattern is to insert your `Optix::command` blocks directly
at the module level so they get invoked during class-loading.
This way your CLI assembles itself automatically and the
command-hierarchy mirrors the modules/classes that
are actually loaded.


### Optix::command DSL

Within `Optix::command` the following directives are available:

### desc

Short description, displayed in the subcommand-list on the help-screen of the *parent* command.

```ruby
Optix::command "frobnitz" do
  desc "Frobnicates the gizmo"
end
```

### text

Long description, displayed on the help-screen for this command.

```ruby
Optix::command "frobnitz" do
  text "Frobnicate the gizmo by subtle twiddling."
  text "Please only apply this to 2-state devices or you might bork it."
end
```

* May be called multiple times for a multi-line description.


### opt

Declares an option.

```ruby
Optix::command do
  opt :some_name, "some description", :default => 'some_default'
end
```

Takes the following optional arguments:

  * `:long` Specify the long form of the argument, i.e. the form with two dashes. 
    If unspecified, will be automatically derived based on the argument name by turning the name
    option into a string, and replacing any _'s by -'s.

  * `:short` Specify the short form of the argument, i.e. the form with one dash.
    If unspecified, will be automatically derived from argument name.

  * `:type` Require that the argument take a parameter or parameters of a given type. For a *single parameter*,
    the value can be one of **:int**, **:integer**, **:string**, **:double**, **:float**, **:io**, **:date**,
    or a corresponding Ruby class (e.g. **Integer** for **:int**).
    For *multiple-argument parameters*, the value can be one of **:ints**, **:integers**, **:strings**, **:doubles**,
    **:floats**, **:ios** or **:dates**. If unset, the default argument type is **:flag**, meaning that the argument
    does not take a parameter. The specification of `:type` is not necessary if a `:default` is given.

  * `:default` Set the default value for an argument. Without a default value, the opts-hash passed to `exec{}`
    and `filter{}` will have a *nil* value for this key unless the argument is given on the commandline.
    The argument type is derived automatically from the class of the default value given, so specifying a `:type`
    is not necessary if a `:default` is given. (But see below for an important caveat when `:multi` is specified too.)
    If the argument is a flag, and the default is set to **true**, then if it is specified on the the commandline
    the value will be **false**.

  * `:required` If set to **true**, the argument must be provided on the commandline.

  * `:multi` If set to **true**, allows multiple occurrences of the option on the commandline. 
    Otherwise, only a single instance of the option is allowed.

    Note that there are two types of argument multiplicity: an argument
    can take multiple values, e.g. "--arg 1 2 3". An argument can also
    be allowed to occur multiple times, e.g. "--arg 1 --arg 2".
    
    Arguments that take multiple values should have a `:type` parameter
    or a `:default` value of an array of the correct type (e.g. [String]).
    
    The value of this argument will be an array of the parameters on the
    commandline.
    
    Arguments that can occur multiple times should be marked with
    `:multi => true`. The value of this argument will also be an array.
    In contrast with regular non-multi options, if not specified on
    the commandline, the default value will be [], not nil.
    
    These two attributes can be combined (e.g. **:type => :strings**,
    **:multi => true**), in which case the value of the argument will be
    an array of arrays.
    
    There's one ambiguous case to be aware of: when `:multi` is **true** and a
    `:default` is set to an array (of something), it's ambiguous whether this
    is a multi-value argument as well as a multi-occurrence argument.
    In thise case, we assume that it's not a multi-value argument.
    If you want a multi-value, multi-occurrence argument with a default
    value, you must specify `:type` as well.

### params

Describes positional parameters that this command accepts.

```ruby
Optix::command do
  params "<foo> [bar]"
end
```

* Note: Optix does **not** validate or inspect positional parameters at all (this is your job, inside exec{}).
  The value of this command is only used to display a proper synopsis in the help-screen.

### depends

Marks two (or more!) options as requiring each other. Only handles
undirected (i.e., mutual) dependencies.

```ruby
Optix::command do
  opt :we,     ""
  opt :are,    ""
  opt :family, ""
  depends :we, :are, :family
end
```

### conflicts

Marks two (or more!) options as conflicting.

```ruby
Optix::command do
  opt :force, "Force this operation"
  opt :no_op, "Dry run, don't actually do anything"
  conflict :force, :no_op
end
```

### trigger

Triggers allow to short-circuit argument parsing for "action-options"
(options that directly trigger an action) such as `--version`.

```ruby
Optix::command do
  opt :version, "Print version and exit"
  trigger :version do
    puts "Version 1.0"
  end
end
```

* Triggers fire *before* validation.

* Parsing stops after a trigger has fired.

* A trigger can only be bound to an existing `opt`. I.e. you must first
  declare `opt :version` before you can bind a trigger with `trigger
  :version`.

* A trigger may be bound to multiple options like so: `trigger [:version,
  :other, :etc] do ...`

* You may raise `Optix::HelpNeeded` inside your trigger to abort
  parsing and display the help-screen.


### filter

Filters allow to group functionality that is common to a branch of subcommands.

```ruby
Optix::command do
  opt :debug, "Enable debugging"
  filter do |cmd, opts, argv|
    if opts[:debug]
      # .. enable debugging ..
    end
  end
end
```

* Filters fire *after* validation, for each command in the chain.

* Parsing continues normally after a filter has fired.

* Your block receives three arguments:
    * `cmd` (Array) The full command that was executed, e.g.: ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']
    * `opts` (Hash) The options-hash, e.g.: { :debug => true }
    * `argv` (Array) Positional parameters that your command may have received, e.g.: ['a','b','c']

* You may raise `Optix::HelpNeeded` inside your filter to abort
  parsing and display the help-screen.


### exec

The exec-block is called when your command is invoked, after validation
passed. It should contain (or invoke) your actual business logic.

```ruby
Optix::command do
  exec do |cmd, opts, argv|
    if opts[:debug]
      # .. enable debugging ..
    end
  end
end
```

* Your block receives three arguments:
    * `cmd` (Array) The full command that was executed, e.g.: ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']
    * `opts` (Hash) The options-hash, e.g.: { :debug => true }
    * `argv` (Array) Positional parameters that your command may have received, e.g.: ['a','b','c']

* You may raise `Optix::HelpNeeded` inside your exec-block to abort
  parsing and display the help-screen.


## Chain of execution

This is the chain of execution when you pass ['foo', 'bar', 'batz'] to `Optix.invoke!`:

  1. Triggers for `foo` (if any, execution stops if a trigger fires)
  1. Triggers for `bar` (if any, execution stops if a trigger fires)
  1. Triggers for `batz` (if any, execution stops if a trigger fires)
  1. Validation
  1. Filters for `foo` (if any)
  1. Filters for `bar` (if any)
  1. Filters for `batz` (if any)
  1. Exec{}-block for `batz`



## Scopes

In rare cases you may want to have multiple independent Optix command-trees in a single app.
This can be achieved by passing a scope-name to your command-declarations, like so:

```ruby
# Declare root-command in the :default scope
Optix::command '', :default do
  # opts, triggers, etc
end

# Declare root-command in another, independent scope
Optix::command '', :other_scope do
end

# Declare a sub-command in the other scope
Optix::command 'sub', :other_scope do
end

# Then either invoke the :default scope
Optix.invoke!(ARGV)
# ...or...
Optix.invoke!(ARGV, :other_scope)
```

## Re-initialization

In even rarer cases you may need to reset Optix at runtime.
To make Optix forget all scopes, configuration and commands, invoke:

`Optix.reset!`
