# Optix

Optix is an unobtrusive, composable command line parser based on Trollop.
It is intended to be a lighter weight alternative to [Thor](https://github.com/wycats/thor).


## Features

* Convenient, declarative syntax (similar to [Thor](https://github.com/wycats/thor))

* Nested subcommands such as `git remote show origin` may be composed at runtime in arbitrary order.

* Subcommands inherit from their parent. Common options (such as '--debug' or '--loglevel')
  need to be declared only once to make them available to an entire branch.

* Stands on the shoulders of [Trollop](http://trollop.rubyforge.org) (by William Morgan), one of the
  most advanced option-parser implementations available.

* Automatic validation and help-screens.

* Should work on all major Ruby versions (tested on 1.9.3, 1.9.2 and 1.8.7).


## Installation

    $ gem install optix

## Example

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

require 'optix'

module Example
  class Printer < Optix::CLI

    # Declare global cli-options
    cli_root do
      # A label to be printed on the root help-screen
      text "I am printer. I print strings to the screen."
      text "Please invoke one of my not so many sub-commands."
      
      # An option that is inherited by all commands
      opt :debug, "Enable debugging", :default => false
    end
    
    # Declare a command called "print"
    desc "Print a string"
    text "Print a string to the screen"
    opt :count, "Print how many times?", :default => 1
    params "<string>"
    def print(cmd, opts, argv)
      if argv.length < 1
        raise Optix::HelpNeeded
      end

      puts "DEBUGGING IS ENABLED!" if opts[:debug]
      (1..opts[:count]).each do
        puts argv.join(' ')
      end
    end
  end
end

if __FILE__ == $0
  # Perform the actual parsing and execution.
  Optix.invoke!(ARGV)
end
```

The above code in action:

```
$ ./printer.rb --help

Usage: ./printer.rb <subcommand>
 
I am printer. I print strings to the screen.
Please invoke one of my not so many sub-commands.
 
Options:
  --debug, -d:   Enable debugging
   --help, -h:   Show this message

Commands:
   print   Print a string
 
```

See the `examples/`-folder for more elaborate examples.

## Documentation

A cli is built using the declarative Optix DSL inside the body
of at least one sub-class of `Optix::CLI`.

After the declarations have been loaded you invoke the parser
with a call to `Optix.invoke!(ARGV)`. It will parse and validate
the input (in this case: ARGV), create an instance of the class
that contains the requested command-method, and call said method
with the user-supplied opts and arguments.

In case of a validation error Optix displays an adequate
error-message and auto-generated help-screen.

If your program loads multiple sub-classes of `Optix::CLI`
then the resulting cli will be the sum of all declarations in
any of them.

Optix is agnostic towards the order of declarations; a sub-command
declaration is allowed to appear before its parent. This feature allows
for very dynamic user interfaces to be generated at runtime, e.g.
via conditionals or dynamic class-loading.


### Commands and Sub-Commands

In Optix all commands are created equal. In order to nest
commands you simply declare them with a `parent`. The minimum
code to create a program that can be invoked as `program.rb hello world`
would look like this:

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

require 'optix'

module Example
  class HelloWorld < Optix::CLI

    # Declare a command called "world" as child of "hello"
    parent 'hello'
    def world(cmd, opts, argv)
      puts "Hello world!"
    end
  end
end

if __FILE__ == $0
  # Perform the actual parsing and execution.
  Optix.invoke!(ARGV)
end
```

You'll notice that we didn't actually declare the parent-command itself (`hello`).
In optix this isn't necessary, any gaps in the hierarchy are automatically filled in.

Commands may be nested to any depth, e.g. try this parent in the above code: `parent 'shout at the'`.

## Commands that have sub-commands can not be invoked

When you have a command `foo bar` then the parent command `foo` can not be invoked.
It will still appear in help-screens and behave as expected, though.
This is a deliberate constraint enforced by Optix in order to protect the sanity of your users.

## Helpers

Optix ignores all methods that aren't preceded by a DSL-directive
(e.g. `parent`, `desc` or `opt`). Thus you don't need to do anything
special to mix command-methods with helper-methods.

Example:

```ruby
module Example
  class HelperExample < Optix::CLI

    # This method becomes a command because it is
    # preceded by an optix-directive ('parent')
    parent 'hello'
    def world(cmd, opts, argv)
      puts "Hello world!"
    end

    # This method is ignored by Optix
    def iam_a_helper(yay)
      # ...
    end
  end
end
```


### Optix DSL

The following directives are available:

### desc

Short description, displayed in the subcommand-list on the help-screen of the *parent* command.

```ruby
module Example
  class Frobnitz < Optix::CLI

    desc 'Frobnicate a gizmo'
    def frob(cmd, opts, argv)
      ...
    end
  end
end
```

### text

Long description, displayed on the help-screen for this command.

```ruby
module Example
  class Frobnitz < Optix::CLI

    text "Frobnicate the gizmo by subtle twiddling."
    text "Please only apply this to 2-state devices or you might bork it."
    def frob(cmd, opts, argv)
      ...
    end
  end
end
```

* May be called multiple times for a multi-line description.

### parent

Specifies the parent for this command.

```ruby
module Example
  class Frobnitz < Optix::CLI

    parent 'foo bar', ['desc for foo', 'desc for bar']
    def batz(cmd, opts, argv)
      puts "foo bar batz was called!"
    end
  end
end
```

* Commands may be nested to any depth (delimited by whitespace), missing
  parts of the hierarchy are filled in automatically.

* The second argument to `parent` is an optional array of descriptions (`desc`) for
  the auto-generated parents.

* Use the special `parent :none` to describe the root-command in programs that
  should accept arguments directly (`foo.rb --debug=true`) without any
  commands (`foo.rb command --debug=true`). See `examples/thor_style/bare.rb`
  for an example of this.

### cli_root

Takes a block (DSL-enabled) to declare the root-command.

You normally use this to specify the help-text that is to be displayed
on the root-screen (`foo.rb --help`), default opts that should be inherited
by all commands, and any top-level filters and triggers.

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

require 'optix'

module Example
  class Frobnitz < Optix::CLI

    # Declare the root-command
    cli_root do
      # A label to be printed on the root help-screen
      text "I am printer. I print strings to the screen."
      text "Please invoke one of my not so many sub-commands."
      
      # An option that is inherited by all commands
      opt :debug, "Enable debugging", :default => false

      # Support '--version' and '-v'
      opt :version, "Print version and exit"
      trigger :version do
        puts "Version 1.0"
      end
    end
    
    # Declare a command called "print"
    desc "Print a string"
    text "Print a string to the screen"
    opt :count, "Print how many times?", :default => 1
    params "<string>"
    def print(cmd, opts, argv)
      if argv.length < 1
        raise Optix::HelpNeeded
      end

      if opts[:debug]
        # ...
      end
    end
  end
end

if __FILE__ == $0
  # Perform the actual parsing and execution.
  Optix.invoke!(ARGV)
end
```

* If you're composing your cli from multiple Optix::Cli-subclasses
  then the `cli_root`-block probably feels a bit awkward because
  you're not sure in which class to put it. In that case please take
  a look at `examples/thor_style/kitchen_sink.rb` for the alternative
  singleton-style syntax that is usually a better fit in these scenarios.

### opt

Declares an option.

```ruby
module Example
  class Frobnitz < Optix::CLI

    opt :some_name, "some description", :default => 'some_default'
    def frob(cmd, opts, argv)
      ...
    end
  end
end
```

Takes the following optional arguments:

  * `:long` Specify the long form of the argument, i.e. the form with two dashes. 
    If unspecified, will be automatically derived based on the argument name by turning the name
    option into a string, and replacing any _'s by -'s.

  * `:short` Specify the short form of the argument, i.e. the form with one dash.
    If unspecified, will be automatically derived from argument name.

  * `:type` Require that the argument take a parameter or parameters of a given type. For a *single parameter*,
    the value can be one of **:int**, **:integer**, **:string**, **:double**, **:float**, **:io**, **:date**,
    or a corresponding Ruby class (e.g. **Integer** for **:int**).
    For *multiple-argument parameters*, the value can be one of **:ints**, **:integers**, **:strings**, **:doubles**,
    **:floats**, **:ios** or **:dates**. If unset, the default argument type is **:flag**, meaning that the argument
    does not take a parameter. The specification of `:type` is not necessary if a `:default` is given.

  * `:default` Set the default value for an argument. Without a default value, the opts-hash passed to `exec{}`
    and `filter{}` will have a *nil* value for this key unless the argument is given on the commandline.
    The argument type is derived automatically from the class of the default value given, so specifying a `:type`
    is not necessary if a `:default` is given. (But see below for an important caveat when `:multi` is specified too.)
    If the argument is a flag, and the default is set to **true**, then if it is specified on the the commandline
    the value will be **false**.

  * `:required` If set to **true**, the argument must be provided on the commandline.

  * `:multi` If set to **true**, allows multiple occurrences of the option on the commandline. 
    Otherwise, only a single instance of the option is allowed.

    Note that there are two types of argument multiplicity: an argument
    can take multiple values, e.g. "--arg 1 2 3". An argument can also
    be allowed to occur multiple times, e.g. "--arg 1 --arg 2".
    
    Arguments that take multiple values should have a `:type` parameter
    or a `:default` value of an array of the correct type (e.g. [String]).
    
    The value of this argument will be an array of the parameters on the
    commandline.
    
    Arguments that can occur multiple times should be marked with
    `:multi => true`. The value of this argument will also be an array.
    In contrast with regular non-multi options, if not specified on
    the commandline, the default value will be [], not nil.
    
    These two attributes can be combined (e.g. **:type => :strings**,
    **:multi => true**), in which case the value of the argument will be
    an array of arrays.
    
    There's one ambiguous case to be aware of: when `:multi` is **true** and a
    `:default` is set to an array (of something), it's ambiguous whether this
    is a multi-value argument as well as a multi-occurrence argument.
    In thise case, we assume that it's not a multi-value argument.
    If you want a multi-value, multi-occurrence argument with a default
    value, you must specify `:type` as well.

### params

Describes positional parameters that this command accepts.

```ruby
module Example
  class Frobnitz < Optix::CLI
    params "<foo> [bar]"
    def frob(cmd, opts, argv)
      ...
    end
  end
end
```

* Note: Optix does **not** validate or inspect positional parameters. This is up to you inside your method.
  The value of this command is only used by Optix to display a proper synopsis in the help-screen.

### depends

Marks two (or more!) options as requiring each other. Only handles
undirected (i.e., mutual) dependencies.

```ruby
module Example
  class Frobnitz < Optix::CLI

    opt :we,     ""
    opt :are,    ""
    opt :family, ""
    depends :we, :are, :family
    def frob(cmd, opts, argv)
      ...
    end
  end
end
```

### conflicts

Marks two (or more!) options as conflicting.

```ruby
module Example
  class Frobnitz < Optix::CLI

    opt :force, "Force this operation"
    opt :no_op, "Dry run, don't actually do anything"
    conflict :force, :no_op
    def frob(cmd, opts, argv)
      ...
    end
  end
end
```

### trigger

Triggers short-circuit argument parsing for "action-options"
(options that directly trigger an action) such as `--version`.

```ruby
module Example
  class Frobnitz < Optix::CLI

    opt :version, "Print version and exit"
    trigger :version do
      puts "Version 1.0"
    end
    def frob(cmd, opts, argv)
      ...
    end
  end
end
```

* Triggers fire *before* validation.

* Parsing stops after a trigger has fired.

* A trigger can only be bound to an existing `opt`. I.e. you must first
  declare `opt :version` before you can bind a trigger with `trigger
  :version`.

* A trigger may be bound to multiple options like so: `trigger [:version,
  :other, :etc] do ...`

* You may raise `Optix::HelpNeeded` inside your trigger to abort
  parsing and display the help-screen.


### filter

Filters group functionality that is common to a branch of sub-commands.

```ruby
module Example
  class Frobnitz < Optix::CLI

    opt :debug, "Enable debugging"
    filter do |cmd, opts, argv|
      if opts[:debug]
        # .. enable debugging ..
      end
    end
    def frob(cmd, opts, argv)
      ...
    end
  end
end
```

* Filters fire *after* validation, for each command in the chain.

* Parsing continues normally after a filter has fired.

* Your block receives three arguments:
    * `cmd` (Array) The full command that was executed, e.g.: ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']
    * `opts` (Hash) The options-hash, e.g.: { :debug => true }
    * `argv` (Array) Positional parameters that your command may have received, e.g.: ['a','b','c']

* You may raise `Optix::HelpNeeded` inside your filter to abort
  parsing and display the help-screen.


### Method signature

```ruby
module Example
  class Frobnitz < Optix::CLI

    def frob(cmd, opts, argv)
      ...
    end
  end
end
```

* Your command-method receives three arguments:
    * `cmd` (Array) The full command that was executed, e.g.: ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']
    * `opts` (Hash) The options-hash, e.g.: { :debug => true }
    * `argv` (Array) Positional parameters that your command may have received, e.g.: ['a','b','c']

* You may raise `Optix::HelpNeeded` to abort parsing and display the help-screen.


## Chain of execution

This is the chain of execution when you pass ['foo', 'bar', 'batz'] to `Optix.invoke!`:

  1. Triggers for `foo` (if any, execution stops if a trigger fires)
  1. Triggers for `bar` (if any, execution stops if a trigger fires)
  1. Triggers for `batz` (if any, execution stops if a trigger fires)
  1. Validation
  1. Filters for `foo` (if any)
  1. Filters for `bar` (if any)
  1. Filters for `batz` (if any)
  1. Exec{}-block for `batz`

## Advanced usage

Optix can be shaped into many forms, this document
only describes the most common usage pattern.

Please see the specs, source-code and the examples in `examples/singleton_style`
for advanced usage examples (e.g. integrating Optix w/o sub-classing,
lower level API, scoping, etc.).
